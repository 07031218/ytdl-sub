## TODO
A sloppy todo list file where I write any issues/things to address that pop in my head
- Add more tests with coverage
- Validate output paths work before downloading
- Maintain playlist ordering
  - Suppose you download a YT playlist and you want the ordering in your filenames. Then someone edits the playlist by deleting a video, changing order, etc. How do you deal with that?
